# Groundlight

Groundlight makes it simple to understand images. You can easily create computer vision detectors just by describing what you want to know using natural language. Groundlight uses a combination of advanced AI and real-time human monitors to automatically turn your images and queries into a customized machine learning (ML) model for your application.

## How it works

Groundlight uses a combination of AI and human input to provide accurate and reliable answers
to questions about your images. Here's how it works:

1. You provide Groundlight with a set of images that you want to analyze.
2. Groundlight uses these images to train a custom computer vision model for you.
3. You can then use this model to answer yes-no questions about your images, such as "Is the door locked?" or "Is there a person waiting in line at the cash register?"
4. When Groundlight encounters a question it can't answer with high confidence, it escalates the query to a more advanced model, or to a team of human annotators who provide the answer within minutes.
